<p>
With this handy package you can send iOS and Android push notifications from your Laravel app: <a
href="https://github.com/davibennun/laravel-push-notification">davibennun/laravel-push-notification</a>.
</p>
<p>
Following the Installation and Configuration instructions get you up and running but bear this in mind:
</p>
<strong>NO</strong>
{% highlight php linenos %}
PushNotification::app('your.appname')
	->to('your device token goes in this method call')
	->send('Hello World');
{% endhighlight %}
<strong>YES</strong>
{% highlight php linenos %}
PushNotification::app('your.appname')
	->to('yourdevicetokengoesinthismethodcall')
	->send('Hello World');
{% endhighlight %}
Otherwise you'll get something like this:
{% highlight php %}
Adapter Apns does not supports tokens device
{% endhighlight %}
<strong>Update (15/07/2014)</strong>
Also, make sure you do not include the <code><</code> and <code>></code> characters in your token.  It seems that leaving in
<code><</code>s and <code>></code>s is allowed in some Ruby Gems I've tried but not in this Laravel package.
