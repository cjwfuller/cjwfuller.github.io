<p>This blog has been migrated from my old <a href="http://cjwfuller.wordpress.com">Wordpress blog</a>.  The old blog looked okay but
it didn't handle code formatting very well and most of this blog is about code.  Moreover, Jekyll lets me stay in the command line instead of
having to logging into Wordpress.</p>
