The following all worked when I installed PyQt4:
{% highlight bash linenos %}
brew update
brew install pyqt
brew test pyqt
{% endhighlight %}
Line 3 is a test that shows a small Qt GUI (this worked).  However, I could not import the module:
{% highlight python %}
python
>>> import PyQt4
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
No module named PyQt4
{% endhighlight %}
I think it was because I have multiple versions of Python on this old system.  Python was probably installed with MacPorts (or something)
and also brew.  Running the following fixed the problem:
{% highlight bash %}
brew link python
{% endhighlight %}
this will ensure that <pre>which python</pre> points to the brew Python which is the Python being used to run
<pre>brew test pyqt</pre>
which we know works.
