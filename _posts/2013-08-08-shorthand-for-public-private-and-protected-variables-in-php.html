<p>I realised today that you can do this:
<pre>
class Monster {
    private
        $colour;
    public
        $size,
        $isEvil;
}
</pre>
instead of this:</p>
<p>
<pre>
class Monster {
    private $colour;
    public $size,
    public $isEvil;
}
</pre>
in PHP which cool. It reminds me of C++. I guess it can come in handy if you have many variables that are all private or all protected, ...</p>
