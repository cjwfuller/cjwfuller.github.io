<p>I realised today that you can do this:<br />
[code lang="php"]<br />
class Monster {<br />
    private<br />
        $colour;<br />
    public<br />
        $size,<br />
        $isEvil;<br />
}<br />
[/code]<br />
instead of this:</p>
<p>[code lang="php"]<br />
class Monster {<br />
    private $colour;<br />
    public $size,<br />
    public $isEvil;<br />
}<br />
[/code]<br />
in PHP which cool. It reminds me of C++. I guess it can come in handy if you have many variables that are all private or all protected, ...</p>
