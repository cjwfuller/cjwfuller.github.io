<p>This morning I hacked together a web app in about 2 hours (as you can probably tell).  The application just checks whether a food is low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FODMAP">FODMAP</a> or not.
</p>
<br>

<p>It's hosted on S3 <a href="http://fodmap.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/">here</a>
  (it doesn't even have a domain yet).</p>
  <br>Technology is nothing fancy at the moment:
<br>

<ul>
  <li>Python SimpleHTTPServer for local development</li>
  <li>Gulp task runner</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
</ul>
If anyone actually visits the site then I'll probably introduce:
<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Elasticsearch with typeahead</li>
</ul>
</p>
