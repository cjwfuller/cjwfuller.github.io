<p>It turns out that the FODMAP checker I hacked together (<a href="http://blog.cjwfuller.com/2016/08/28/fodmap-checker-hack/">see initial post</a>) is getting quite a lot of traffic so now I'm putting some more time into it.  The FODMAP checker can be found at <a href="www.fodmapchecker.com">www.fodmapchecker.com</a></p>

<p>I posted about the site on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FODMAPS/comments/52vedm/ive_been_working_on_a_fodmap_checker_website_for/">here</a> and got some great feedback.  Here is a summary of the things I've had a chance to implement - they're available to use now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change wording to be "No information is available on X" if a food isn't in the database</li>
  <li>Have a list of known low and high FODMAP foods instead of just a high-FODMAP list and change algorithm to look at both lists</li>
  <li>Search substrings e.g. "an onion" should match "onion" / "spring onion"...</li>
</ul>

<p>I've also been emailed asking for this idea to be made into an iOS or Android app.  The first step is probably to introduce <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> so the code is cleaner and to make it less effort to write mobile apps from existing code.</p>
