<p>
  Over the past 5 years, I have read and written a great deal of PHP code.  Some code shone in PHP excellence while other code wreaked of PHP stench.
</p>

<p>
  PHP is everywhere but it doesn't mean it's any good.

<h4>Encourages buggy code</h4>
<p>
  The PHP docs for <code>strpos</code> comes with a warning:
  <i>"This function may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a non-Boolean value which evaluates to FALSE. Please read the section on Booleans for more information. Use the === operator for testing the return value of this function."</i>.  <code>strpos</code> will return <code>0</code> if it finds the needle at position zero, but <code>false</code> if they donâ€™t find it at all.  Sure, you can just be perfect andse the function with the strict inequality operator but humans make mistakes and this sort of design encourages buggy code.

<h4>Tries to be procedural and OO</h4>
