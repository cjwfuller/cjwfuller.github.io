  This weekend I rode the <a href="http://www.strava.com/local/au/sydney/cycling/routes/126">Akuna Bay Loop</a> but when I got home my Garmin 810 said something like <i>"Congratulations!  Your training is complete"</i> but then it just
  turned off.  I turned it back on with a feeling of dread and the ride was gone!
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, for me I could recover the .fit file and upload to Strava:
  <ul>
    <li>Connect Garmin to computer via USB</li>
    <li>Open Finder or whatever file manager you use</li>
    <li>Navigate to the GARMIN device</li>
    <li>Navigate to Activities</li>
    <li>(Hopefully) Find your .fit file that never got uploaded to Garmin Connect</li>
    <li>Copy .fit file to somewhere safe</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.strava.com/upload/select">Upload to Strava</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>
