I was interested to see how many commands I executed in the current given day.  Solutions for <code>zsh</code> and <code>bash</code> are a little different:
<h3>zsh</h3>
<pre>fc -l -i 1 | grep $(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) | wc -l</pre>
You would think <code>history</code> would have done the trick but I couldn't get the timestamps working in <code>zsh</code> so I had to use <code>fc</code> (I think <code>fc</code> means Fix Command).
<h3>bash</h3>
Bash is a little easier but you need to make sure you have <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> set so the <code>history</code> command shows timestamps:
<p>
<code>
export HISTTIMEFORMAT=&quot;%Y-%m-%d &quot;
history | grep $(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) | wc -l
</code>
</p>
<p>Important!  If <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> was not set before then you will need to be patient because your commands before the time that you set the <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> will be timestamped with the time that you set it so it will probably like you have executed more commands than you have today.</p>
