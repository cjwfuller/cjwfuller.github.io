<p>I was interested to see how many commands I executed in the current given day.  Solutions for <code>zsh</code> and <code>bash</code> are a little different:</p>
<h3>zsh</h3>
<p>[code lang="bash"]<br />
fc -l -i 1 | grep $(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) | wc -l<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>You would think <code>history</code> would have done the trick but I couldn't get the timestamps working in <code>zsh</code> so I had to use <code>fc</code> (I think <code>fc</code> means Fix Command).</p>
<h3>bash</h3>
<p>Bash is a little easier but you need to make sure you have <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> set so the <code>history</code> command shows timestamps:</p>
<p>[code lang="bash"]<br />
export HISTTIMEFORMAT=&quot;%Y-%m-%d &quot;<br />
history | grep $(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;) | wc -l<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Important!  If <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> was not set before then you will need to be patient because your commands before the time that you set the <code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code> will be timestamped with the time that you set it so it will probably like you have executed more commands than you have today.</p>
