<p>Albert Einstein once said</p>
<blockquote><p>If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough</p>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(On the other hand, apparently he also said</p>
<blockquote><p>If I could explain it to the average person, I wouldn't have been worth the Nobel Prize</p>
<p> </p>
<p>)</p>
