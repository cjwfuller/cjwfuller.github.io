Artisan Tinker is an Artisan command.  You can view its source <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/4.2/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Console/TinkerCommand.php#L27">here</a>.  TinkerCommand contains the following:
{% highlight php %}
public function fire()
{
	if ($this->supportsBoris())
	{
		$this->runBorisShell();
	}
	else
	{
		$this->comment('Full REPL not supported. Falling back to simple shell.');
		$this->runPlainShell();
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

so it uses the Boris shell (if supported).  <a href="https://github.com/borisrepl/boris/blob/master/lib/Boris/Boris.php#L13">Boris.php</a> contains an private property called <code>$historyFile</code>.  If you look at where Boris is instantiated, you'll probably find that the history file is located in <code>~/.boris_history</code>:

{% highlight bash %}
cat ~/.boris_history
_HiStOrY_V2_
User::all()->toArray();
exit;
{% endhighlight %}
