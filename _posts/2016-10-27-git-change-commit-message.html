<p>A couple of commands that I'm always using that are super useful <strong>unless you have already pushed</strong>:</p>

<p><code>git commit --amend</code> - changes your last commit message</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><code>git rebase -i yourcommithash~1</code> - changes some other commit message</p>

<p>Details:</p>

<p><code>git commit --amend</code> can be used on its own or if you don't want to get dropped into vim / emacs (whatever <code>$GIT_EDITOR</code> is set to): <code>git commit --amend -m "your new message"</code></p>

<p><code>git rebase -i yourcommithash~1</code> will open your editor with the commit you want to rename and the commits before it.  Change <code>pick</code> to <code>r</code>, save and exit (don't rename the commit in the list of commits), rename the commit then and save and exit.  Done.</p>

<p>This is only safe if you haven't pushed because other Developers may have pulled your old commits and you're rewriting history by doing this (if it's just you working on a project and you know what you're doing, you can pass the <code>-f</code> to <code>git push</code> if you have already pushed to ignore git's no push warning).</p>
