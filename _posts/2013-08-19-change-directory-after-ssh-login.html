<p>When I login to a particular server of mine, I nearly always want to go to a certain directory instead of the default <code>/home/chris</code>.  </p>
<p>I use <code>zsh</code> as my shell so I just needed to put this at the top of my <code>/home/chris/.zshrc</code> file: <code>cd /usr/local/someplace</code> (put this in <code>.bashrc</code> for you bash users).  </p>
<p>You <strong>can't</strong> put it in your <code>.profile</code> because <code>cd</code> is built into your actual shell.  If you don't believe me then run <code>man bash</code> and you will see something like</p>
<p>[code]<br />
BASH_BUILTINS(1)                                              BASH_BUILTINS(1)<br />
NAME<br />
       bash, :, ., [, alias, bg, bind, break, builtin, caller, cd, command, ...<br />
[/code]</p>
